                   recently, making major progress in key domains such as
                   vision, language, control, and decision-making. This has
                   been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute
                   resources, which have fit the natural strengths of deep
                   learning. However, many defining characteristics of human
                   intelligence, which developed under much different
                   pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches. In
                   particular, generalizing beyond one's experiences--a
                   hallmark of human intelligence from infancy--remains a
                   formidable challenge for modern AI. The following is part
                   position paper, part review, and part unification. We argue
                   that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for
                   AI to achieve human-like abilities, and that structured
                   representations and computations are key to realizing this
                   objective. Just as biology uses nature and nurture
                   cooperatively, we reject the false choice between
                   ``hand-engineering'' and ``end-to-end'' learning, and
                   instead advocate for an approach which benefits from their
                   complementary strengths. We explore how using relational
                   inductive biases within deep learning architectures can
                   facilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for
                   composing them. We present a new building block for the AI
                   toolkit with a strong relational inductive bias--the graph
                   network--which generalizes and extends various approaches
                   for neural networks that operate on graphs, and provides a
                   straightforward interface for manipulating structured
                   knowledge and producing structured behaviors. We discuss how
                   graph networks can support relational reasoning and
                   combinatorial generalization, laying the foundation for more
                   sophisticated, interpretable, and flexible patterns of

                   isomorphism tasks and countable feature spaces. We extend
                   this theoretical framework to include continuous features -

                   images, but have significant challenges in dealing with
                   graph data. Given images are special cases of graphs with
                   nodes lie on 2D lattices, graph embedding tasks have a
                   natural correspondence with image pixel-wise prediction
                   tasks such as segmentation. While encoder-decoder
                   architectures like U-Nets have been successfully applied on
                   many image pixel-wise prediction tasks, similar methods are
                   lacking for graph data. This is due to the fact that pooling
                   and up-sampling operations are not natural on graph data. To
                   address these challenges, we propose novel graph pooling
                   (gPool) and unpooling (gUnpool) operations in this work. The
                   gPool layer adaptively selects some nodes to form a smaller
                   graph based on their scalar projection values on a trainable

                   restores the graph into its original structure using the

                   if these models could reveal the fragment pharmacophores
                   that are causally involved in binding. Extracting chemical
                   details of binding from the networks could potentially lead
                   to scientific discoveries about the mechanisms of drug
                   actions. But doing so requires shining light into the black

                   has proved difficult across many domains. Here we show how
                   the binding mechanism learned by deep neural network models
                   can be interrogated, using a recently described attribution
                   method. We first work with carefully constructed synthetic
                   datasets, in which the 'fragment logic' of binding is fully

              networks",
  author   = "Zitnik, Marinka and Agrawal, Monica and Leskovec, Jure",
  abstract = "Motivation: The use of drug combinations, termed polypharmacy, is
              common to treat patients with complex diseases or co-existing
              conditions. However, a major consequence of polypharmacy is a
              much higher risk of adverse side effects for the patient.
              Polypharmacy side effects emerge because of drug-drug
              interactions, in which activity of one drug may change, favorably
              or unfavorably, if taken with another drug. The knowledge of drug
              interactions is often limited because these complex relationships
              are rare, and are usually not observed in relatively small
              clinical testing. Discovering polypharmacy side effects thus
              remains an important challenge with significant implications for
              patient mortality and morbidity. Results: Here, we present
              Decagon, an approach for modeling polypharmacy side effects. The
              approach constructs a multimodal graph of protein-protein
              interactions, drug-protein target interactions and the
              polypharmacy side effects, which are represented as drug-drug
              interactions, where each side effect is an edge of a different
              type. Decagon is developed specifically to handle such multimodal
              graphs with a large number of edge types. Our approach develops a
              new graph convolutional neural network for multirelational link
              prediction in multimodal networks. Unlike approaches limited to
              predicting simple drug-drug interaction values, Decagon can
              predict the exact side effect, if any, through which a given drug
              combination manifests clinically. Decagon accurately predicts
              polypharmacy side effects, outperforming baselines by up to 69\%.
              We find that it automatically learns representations of side
              effects indicative of co-occurrence of polypharmacy in patients.
              Furthermore, Decagon models particularly well polypharmacy side
              effects that have a strong molecular basis, while on
              predominantly non-molecular side effects, it achieves good
              performance because of effective sharing of model parameters
              across edge types. Decagon opens up opportunities to use large
              pharmacogenomic and patient population data to flag and
              prioritize polypharmacy side effects for follow-up analysis via
              formal pharmacological studies. Availability and implementation:

                   However, modeling complex distributions over graphs and then
                   efficiently sampling from these distributions is challenging
                   due to the non-unique, high-dimensional nature of graphs and
                   the complex, non-local dependencies that exist between edges
                   in a given graph. Here we propose GraphRNN, a deep

                   approximates any distribution of graphs with minimal
                   assumptions about their structure. GraphRNN learns to
                   generate graphs by training on a representative set of

              Compared to previous RNN-based graph generative models, our

              between the already-generated and to-be-generated parts of the

              Moreover, we parameterize the output distribution per block using

                   improvement in quality, some limitations remain to be

                   additional computational overhead, which limits their
                   scalability to large graph databases. Second, many
                   techniques only learn the structure and do not address the
                   need to also learn node and edge labels, which encode
                   important semantic information and influence the structure
                   itself. Third, existing techniques often incorporate
                   domain-specific rules and lack generalizability. Fourth, the
                   experimentation of existing techniques is not comprehensive

  abstract  = "We present a framework, which we call Molecule Deep Q-Networks
               (MolDQN), for molecule optimization by combining domain
               knowledge of chemistry and state-of-the-art reinforcement
               learning techniques (double Q-learning and randomized value
               functions). We directly define modifications on molecules,
               thereby ensuring 100\% chemical validity. Further, we operate
               without pre-training on any dataset to avoid possible bias from
               the choice of that set. MolDQN achieves comparable or better
               performance against several other recently published algorithms
               for benchmark molecular optimization tasks. However, we also
               argue that many of these tasks are not representative of real
               optimization problems in drug discovery. Inspired by problems
               faced during medicinal chemistry lead optimization, we extend
               our model with multi-objective reinforcement learning, which
               maximizes drug-likeness while maintaining similarity to the
               original molecule. We further show the path through chemical
               space to achieve optimization for a molecule to understand how
               the model works.",
